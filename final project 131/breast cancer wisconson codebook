-`ID` : Sample code number

-`clump_thickness` : grouping of cancer cells in multilayer

-`uniformity_size`: metastasis to lymph nodes

-`uniformity_shape`: cancerous cells of varying size

-`marginal_adhesion` : a sign of malignancy but the cancerous cells lose this property so this retention of adhesion is an indication of malignancy

-`single_epithelial_cell_sizer` : also called SECS, if the SECS become larger, then it may be a malignant cell

-`bare_nuclei` : without cytoplasm coating, this is found in benign cells

-`bland_chromatin` : usually found in benign cells

-`normal_nucleoli` : generally very small and in benign cells

-`mitoses` : the process in cell division by which the nucleus divides

-`diagnosis`: two types in our machine learning project, malignant cancer cell and benign cancer cell
 

  
Benign : 458 (65.5%)
Malignant : 241 (34.5%)
Note that 0 = "benign" and 1= "malignant"
